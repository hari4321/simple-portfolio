            <p>
                Hello, I'm Hariprasad S, a passionate and aspiring web developer with a love for all things tech. My
                journey in the world of coding began with a curiosity to understand how websites were built, and since
                then, I've been hooked on creating immersive and user-friendly digital experiences.

            <h3>Titanic Survival Prediction</h3>

            Using machine learning algorithms, I analyzed the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. Python and
            data science libraries were employed for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The project
            provided insights into factors influencing survival chances during the Titanic disaster.

            <h3>Heart Disease Prediction></h3>

            This project focused on building a machine learning model to detect heart disease in patients. Python and
            classification algorithms were utilized for data preparation and model selection. The project contributed to
            understanding heart disease risk factors and their prediction.
